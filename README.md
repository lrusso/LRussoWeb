## Usage

### 404 Error Redirections

The `404.html` file acts as a client-side redirector. If someone tries to access a page on the site that no longer exists or if the web server is not case insensitive (a 404 error), this file checks if that address is in the list. If it is, the user gets sent to the correct page. If the address isn't in the list, the user is redirected to the homepage. Below you will find examples of how to use it.

```javascript
var redirects = {
  "/example1": "/Example1",
  "/example2": "https://www.otherdomain.com",
  "/example3": "https://www.otherdomain.com/Example3",
}
```

### Automated Daily Bot

This GitHub Actions workflow, located in the [cronjob.yml](https://github.com/lrusso/LRussoWeb/blob/main/.github/workflows/cronjob.yml) file, runs a Node.js script on schedule. It requires the [BOT_SETTINGS](#how-to-generate-your-bot_settings-variable) GitHub variable and uses an optional [GOOGLE_API_KEY](#how-to-generate-your-google_api_key-secret) GitHub secret. If the script finds a reportable event and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set, it sends an email. Besides that, the process will fail, triggering a GitHub notification.

### How to generate your BOT_SETTINGS variable?

`BOT_SETTINGS` it's a variable (an object) required by the bot and that you need to create in your repository settings. Here is an example of it:

```json
{
  "checks": {
    "urls": [
      { "https://www.example.com/products": "Out of Stock" },
      { "https://www.anothersite.org/news": ["Breaking News", "Urgent Update"] }
    ],
    "dates": [
      { "2025-12-25": "Christmas Day" },
      { "2026-01-01": "New Year's Day Celebration" }
    ],
    "domains": [
      { "2025-11-15": "mydomain.com" },
      { "2026-03-01": "anotherdomain.net" }
    ],
    "newspapers": [
      {
        "tech": [
          "https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology",

        ]
      },
      {
        "business": [
          "https://www.bloomberg.com/markets",
          "https://www.reuters.com/business"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "userLanguage": "en-US,en;q=0.9,es;q=0.1",
  "emailSubjects": {
    "systemReport": "System report",
    "newspaperHeadlines": "Newspaper headlines"
  }
}
```

### Intranet Virtual Desktop Settings

To set up your Intranet virtual desktop, you'll primarily configure the `DESKTOP_FILES` array for desktop shortcuts and the Screensaver options for your screensaver.

The `DESKTOP_FILES` array allows you to define the shortcuts that appear on your virtual desktop. Each object within this array represents a single shortcut and has the following properties:

- `filename`: The text that appears below the icon on the desktop.

- `icon`: The path to the icon image.

- `content`: The content to display when the shortcut is clicked. This can be raw HTML, an **iframe** embedding another page, or any other valid HTML structure.

Example configuration:

```javascript
var DESKTOP_FILES = [
  {
    filename: "Spider", // Name displayed on desktop
    icon: "Spider.png", // Path to an image file for the icon
    content: "<iframe src='Spider.htm'></iframe>", // Embeds an external HTML page
  },
  {
    filename: "Taipei",
    icon: "Taipei.png",
    content: "<iframe src='Taipei.htm'></iframe>",
  },
  {
    filename: "Hello World",
    icon: "HelloWorld.png",
    content: "<div>Hello World</div>", // Simple HTML content displayed directly
  },
]
```

On the other hand, the screensaver component allows you to configure the behavior and appearance of your virtual desktop's screensaver. You instantiate it with an object containing the following properties:

- `secondsInactive`: The number of seconds of inactivity before the screensaver activates.

- `speed`: Controls the animation speed of the screensaver (e.g., 1 for normal speed).

- `logo`: The path to an image file to display as a logo on the screensaver.

- `disabledWhenUsingIframes`: A boolean value. If true, the screensaver will not activate when an **iframe** is actively being used.

Example configuration:

```javascript
createScreensaver({
  secondsInactive: 30, // Screensaver activates after 30 seconds of inactivity
  speed: 1, // Normal animation speed
  logo: "Logo.png", // Displays "Logo.png" on the screensaver
  disabledWhenUsingIframes: true, // Screensaver won't activate if an iframe is in use
})
```
